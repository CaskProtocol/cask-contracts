# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn test
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat console
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat deploy
yarn hardhat debug
yarn hardhat accounts
```
